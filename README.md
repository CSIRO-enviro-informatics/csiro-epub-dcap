# CSIRO ePublish Dublin Core Application Profile

This is a dummy profile of the Dublin Core standard constructed as a
[Dublin Core Application Profile](http://dublincore.org/documents/profile-guidelines/).

The purpose of creating this dummy profile is to test the power of the
[Profile Description Ontology](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiledesc/) at
representing a particular community's - the Dublin Core community - method of
profile creation.

This dummy has been created during the operations of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s
[Dataset Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/) by members of
that Working Group.


## Dataset contents
This profile is presented as a Linked Data dataset. It consists of only three
data files:

1. **profiledesc.ttl** - a description of the dummy CSIRO ePublish according to the Profile Description Ontology
2. **constraints-dcap-syntax.txt** - dummy constraints of the profile written according to the DCAP Description Set Profile (DSP) syntax
3. **constraints.ttl** - the DSP in RDF (turtle), formulated according to <http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-dsp/>
